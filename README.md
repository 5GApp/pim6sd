PIM-SM/SSM IPv6 Multicast Routing for UNIX
==========================================

pim6sd is an IPv6 Protocol Independent Multicast routing daemon, which
supports both Any-Source as well as Source-Specific Multicast, also known
as PIM-SM and PIM-SSM.

pim6sd stems from pim6dd, which was originally based on [pimd][], which
in turn was based on [mrouted][].


Build & Install
---------------

The configure script and Makefile supports de facto standard settings
and environment variables such as `--prefix=PATH` and `DESTDIR=` for the
install process.  E.g., to install pim6sd to `/usr` instead of the default
`/usr/local`, but redirect install to a package directory in `/tmp`:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
	make
    make DESTDIR=/tmp/pim6sd-2.1.0-1 install-strip


Building from GIT
-----------------

If you want to contribute, or simply just try out the latest but
unreleased features, then you need to know a few things about the
[GNU build system][buildsystem]:

- `configure.ac` and a per-directory `Makefile.am` are key files
- `configure` and `Makefile.in` are generated from `autogen.sh`
- `Makefile` is generated by `configure` script

To build from GIT you first need to clone the repository and run the
`autogen.sh` script.  This requires `automake` and `autoconf` to be
installed on your system.

    git clone https://github.com/troglobit/pim6sd.git
    cd pim6sd/
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure && make

GIT sources are a moving target and are not recommended for production
systems, unless you know what you are doing!
